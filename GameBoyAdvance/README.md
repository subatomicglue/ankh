# ANKH for Nintendo GameBoyAdvance

a recreation of the 1980's AppleIIe prerelease of the game "[ANKH](http://dvb.omino.com/dvb/software/ankh/index.html)" (by [David VanBrink](http://metareal.net/) published by [Datamost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamost).  

 * [.. back one directory](../../..) 
   * [ANKH for Web](../Web) - unfinished work circa 2018 ish...

why recreate the prerelease?  it's the one I played, know well, and love.

everything is recreated from screenshots and playing through the game

**this is an omage:**  much respect and love for this game

**it was my stress relief:**  I worked on this in the early 2000's in my spare time for fun.  Implementing this game from scratch was a fun puzzle to solve.

# Status
I got about 90% of the game working on actual GBA hardware, playable.  But I think ran out of RAM and started getting lockup problems on hardware (worked great in the VirtualBoyAdvance emulator).   Life caught up and then Lost interest.  I don't plan to finish this work.

# Build and Run

To build the game, you'll need a GBA toolchain.
 * Let me google that for you: [How to Compile for GBA](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+compile+for+GBA&oq=how+to+compile+for+GBA)

How to do this is an exercise left to the reader.  Someday I might give more info.  But for now, experienced GBA developers will know what to do, and beginners will need to figure it out.

Once you have built the `gba` file from source code, you can load into an emulator like [VisualBoyAdvance](https://www.google.com/search?q=visualboyadvance&oq=visualboyadvance)
