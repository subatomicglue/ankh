[AUTHENTICITY/POLISH]
verify all doors match real game in 6,8 (lots of doors room)
verify the trap-room controls all match...

finalize karma points in assets.dat (compare to real game)

implement clock in the right-hand UI.  study real game to see how it works...

consider appending instruction text to front end UI
or... press select in the front end ui to show the instructions?

implement high score (can we save it in a save game slot?)  how to display it?

polish:  nubs go away on the other when touch goes out...
polish:  on drop, the touch beam doesn't extend as far as when it picked up...
         especially when it penetrated inside the bbox to pickup...
polish:  implement a step pad?  pad to change the step increment of the player..
         or.. do something smart with timers. bigger step if pressed faster
         or.. study real game, and do what it's doing.!!! :)
